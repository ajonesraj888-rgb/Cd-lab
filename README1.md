Compiler Design Lab Experiments (Lab 1 – Lab 15) 🧑‍💻 📘 Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of Compiler Design Laboratory Experiments (Lab 1 to Lab 15) using C++.

Each experiment is organized into a separate C++ file containing:

C++ source code
Documentation (Algorithm, Input/Output, Explanation) embedded in the file headers.
The repository is designed to be faculty-friendly, viva-ready, and GitHub-professional for academic submission.

🔹 Lab 2: Regular Expression to NFA Conversion of a Regular Expression into an equivalent Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA).

🔹 Lab 3: NFA to DFA Conversion Conversion of an NFA into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the Subset Construction Method.

🔹 Lab 4: Elimination of Left Recursion Implementation of an algorithm to remove left recursion from a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG).

🔹 Lab 5: FIRST and FOLLOW Sets Computation of FIRST and FOLLOW sets for all non-terminals in a given grammar.

🔹 Lab 6: Predictive Parsing Table Construction of an LL(1) Predictive Parsing Table using FIRST and FOLLOW sets.

🔹 Lab 7: Computation of LEADING and TRAILING Sets Computation of LEADING and TRAILING sets for operator precedence parsing.

🔹 Lab 8: Shift-Reduce Parser Implementation of a bottom-up Shift-Reduce Parser using parsing tables.

🔹 Lab 9: Computation of LR(0) Items Construction of LR(0) items and the canonical collection of LR(0) states.

🔹 Lab 10: Intermediate Code Generation (Postfix/Prefix) Conversion of infix arithmetic expressions to Postfix and Prefix intermediate forms.

🔹 Lab 11: ICG (Quadruple, Triple, Indirect Triple) Representation of intermediate code as Quadruples, Triples, and Indirect Triples.

🔹 Lab 12: Simple Code Generator Generation of pseudo assembly code from intermediate Three Address Code (TAC).

🔹 Lab 13: DAG Implementation Implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for common subexpression elimination.

🔹 Lab 14: Global Data Flow Analysis Implementation of data flow analysis using reaching definitions.

🔹 Lab 15: Storage Allocation Strategies Demonstration of stack-based memory allocation and activation records.

▶️ How to Run the Programs 1️⃣ Open the required .cpp file in VS Code or any C++ IDE. 2️⃣ Compile the program using: g++ filename.cpp -o output 3️⃣ Run the program: ./output

📌 Notes All experiments are implemented according to the standard Compiler Design Laboratory syllabus. Detailed algorithms, inputs, and outputs are documented within each .cpp file.
